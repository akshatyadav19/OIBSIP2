# OIBSIP2
Unemployment Analysis Python Project
This is a Python project that analyzes unemployment data to identify trends and patterns. The project consists of several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that use the Pandas library to clean and analyze data.

#Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook and Python 3 installed on your computerr. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn 
Plotly.express 

Once you have installed these libraries, you can clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts and notebooks.

#Data
The data used in this project was provided by Oasis Infobyte. The data includes unemployment rates for various States and regions in the India. The data is provided in a CSV file format and is located in the data directory of this repository. The data file is named"Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv".


This project includes the following scripts:

data_cleaning.py: A Python script that cleans the raw data and prepares it for analysis.
data_analysis.py: A Python script that analyzes the cleaned data and generates visualizations.
data_export.py: A Python script that exports the cleaned and analyzed data to a CSV file.
#Notebooks
This project includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

data_exploration.ipynb: A notebook that explores the raw data and identifies any data quality issues.
data_cleaning.ipynb: A notebook that walks through the data cleaning process and shows how missing values and outliers were handled.
data_analysis.ipynb: A notebook that analyzes the cleaned data and generates visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
#Results
The results of this analysis can be found in the results directory. This directory includes a CSV file containing the cleaned and analyzed data, as well as several visualizations generated by the analysis.

#Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python and the Pandas library can be used to analyze unemployment data and identify trends and patterns. The scripts and notebooks provided can be adapted for use with other datasets and can serve as a starting point for further analysis.
